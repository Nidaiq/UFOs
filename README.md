# UFOs

## Background
Dana is a data journalist, who has been given the opportunity to write about UFO sightings in her hometown McMinnville, Oregon.  McMinnville is famous for its sightings and even has a gathering for UFO enthusiast. Dana has been interested in the topic of UFO's since she was a child. Dana has a JavaScript file filled with sighting information and her plan is to use JavaScript to display the data as a table.  JavaScript allows to manipulate the data by adding filters which would add a unique dynamic to her webpage.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to help Dana put all the data together neatly in an HTML page.  This page would contain Dana's article, table of data to support her findings and easy to use filters to fine-tune the results to what the user would like.  There will be multiple filters involved.

## Results

### Description of how to perform a search with images
Images in the Resources folder would be used for the purpose of this section. 

[Image 1](https://github.com/Nidaiq/UFOs/blob/af1b882fa7225baf21d16aceb424eb2214314405/Resource/image%201.png) shows the top of the webpage with the image set as a background and Dana's article.  [Image 2](https://github.com/Nidaiq/UFOs/blob/6972a0016922071b898ac02407ac46f4ebc6c1f3/Resource/image%202.png) shows the search fields and the data table. It can be noted that there is no search button on the page.  The filter is automated as  the fields are put in by the user.  [Image 3](https://github.com/Nidaiq/UFOs/blob/6972a0016922071b898ac02407ac46f4ebc6c1f3/Resource/image%203.png) shows that 1/1/2010 was put in the "Enter Date" field.  After pressing enter the data table has sorted itself with the appropriate dates.  Similarly, [Image 4](https://github.com/Nidaiq/UFOs/blob/6972a0016922071b898ac02407ac46f4ebc6c1f3/Resource/image%204.png) shows that the state has been put in in the input field.  After pressing enter, the data has been sorted with the date of 1/1/2010 and the State of California.  Looking at [image 5](https://github.com/Nidaiq/UFOs/blob/6972a0016922071b898ac02407ac46f4ebc6c1f3/Resource/image%205.png) it is evident that the shape of light has been entered which filtered the table according to the date, state, and shape fields.  It should be noted that not all fields are required for filtering data. This allows the data filtered to be customized according to what the user requires.

## Summary

### Drawbacks of the design

There are a few drawbacks of this page.  Some of them are listed below:

- The search is case sensitive and will not display results if the fields are added in upper case.

- If anyone types *usa* instead of *us* the search will not yield any results.

- The design is not very visual.  So, the drawback of this design is that the website could have been made more interactive and displayed the data in other manner (maybe as tags on a map to show sightings on the same day).

## Additional recommendations for future development

Some of the recommendations are stated below:

- A search field could be added for durations. 

- Search field could also be modified to add in multiple factors.  So, a user can search for sightings in two or three different cities at the same time.

- The input field can be modified to add dropdowns. It will allow the user to select from a list of input fields. This would remove the errors that can occur if the user has capitalized the letters etc.

- More interactive design could be created.  Maps can be incorporated to show different sightings on the same day.

- Data can also be presented as counts.  For example, adding elements to show how many sightings had reported triangular shaped object between 1/1/2010 and 12/1/2010.
